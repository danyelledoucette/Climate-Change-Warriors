# Climate_Change_Warriors

### Elizabeth: 
Primary: Temperate/Equatorial temperatures (Differences/Patterns/Trends) since industrial rev or 1900 (secondary: gloabl temps)

### Alex: 
Primary: Greenhouse Gas Emissions/Concentration (secondary: breakdown by category, e.g., cars, industry)

### Danyelle: (GitMC) 
Primary: Arctic Ice Extent Analysis (seconday: Greenhouse Gas Emissions/Concentration and help with Ice Core data if needed)

### Ryan: 
SubPolar/Polar Temperature Differences/Patterns/Trends (secondary: data pull, analysis of Ice Core data; some assistance from Danyelle likely)
(if time allows: artic sea ice change)
Temperate Zone:  US: China 

### Research Questions:
(Main RQs)
Do CO2 admissions combined with global temperature variations since the beginning of the industrial revolution provide substantial evidence to support the phenomenon of human induced (anthropogenic) climate change? /
Are there salient trends/patterns in CO2 and temperature data that fortify the anthropogenic theory of climate change?
How has this data been gathered/measured? 
Can the data be trusted and verified? /
What are limiatations in this data? /
Are there holes/gaps in the conclusions drawn from the data that skeptics might exploit to discredit the findings?  What might they be and how would they be answered? 

(RQs to pursue if time/data allows in order of importance)
Is there data to support continued polar ice cap retreat and how does this affect global temperature/climate change?
Assuming the data does support an anthropogenic model of climate change, what effects (past and present) that can be substantially linked to these changes? /
Assuming there is enough data to support the concept of climate change with patterns/trends, what effects (future) might be reasonably projected?

(Super Bonus RQs- only if time and energy allows)
What reasons might individuals/groups have for denying data that supports anthropogenic climate change and how might the data refute these claims?
What reasons might countries/state actors have for denying data that supports anthropogenic climate change and how might the data refute these claims?

END OF GROUP OVERVIEW


Individual RQ Overviews (optional)

### Ryan's Research Questions for Temperature Variation / 
#Has the earth undergone temperature changes in the artic regions ( since cerca the industrial revolution in the West?
#Is there a trend and/or pattern in those temperature changes?
#If patterns/trends are found, where are they most prominent?
#How can these temperature trends be measured?
#Where are temperature trends most salient?
#What are the data sources used to measure temperature over time?
#Why have these data sources been chosen?
#What makes these data sources reliable?
#What evidence might make these data sources questionable, if any?
  ##(Big Idea/Group Question) What are the effects and/or measureable physical changes that can be directly/causaly linked to the temperature trends if any?
How are different measurements/effects of climate change connected with the data from my group members and how can we use this data to measure these connections/networks of effects? Lastly, what conclusions and/or projections for the future can be drawn by combining our data and related findings?
