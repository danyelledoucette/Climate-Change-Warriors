### Research Questions:
Is there substantial and verfiable data that can be used as evidence to support the phenomenon of human induced climate change? /
How has this data been gathered/measured and can the data be trusted and verified? /
Are there trends/patterns in the data that are considerable enough to support a professional analysis with conclusions? What are limiatations in this data? /
If data exists to support climate change, what effects (past and present) that can be substantially linked to these changes? /
Assuming there is enough data to support the concept of climate change with patterns/trends, what projections can be reasonably drawn from the data for the future?
