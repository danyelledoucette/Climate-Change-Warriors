# Climate_Change_Warriors

### Elizabeth: 
Primary: Temperate/Equatorial temperatures (Differences/Patterns/Trends) since industrial rev or 1901. This includes Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Jakarta in Indonesia, and New Orleans and Orange County in United States in America.   

### Alex: 
Primary: Greenhouse Gas Emissions/Concentration (secondary: breakdown by category, e.g., cars, industry)

### Danyelle: (GitMC) 
Primary: Arctic Ice Extent Analysis (seconday: Greenhouse Gas Emissions/Concentration)

### Ryan: 
Primary: SubPolar/Polar Temperature Differences/Patterns/Trends Arctic Zone: Norway, Netherlands. Temp/SubTropic: Hong Kong  Global: Mean Global Temp over time.  artic sea ice change in conjunction with Danyelle's work.  Develop powerpoint presentation. 


### Research Questions:
(Main RQs)
Do CO2 admissions combined with global temperature variations since the beginning of the industrial revolution provide substantial evidence to support the phenomenon of human induced (anthropogenic) climate change? /
Are there salient trends/patterns in CO2 and temperature data that fortify the anthropogenic theory of climate change?
How has this data been gathered/measured? 
Can the data be trusted and verified? /
What are limiatations in this data? /
Are there holes/gaps in the conclusions drawn from the data that skeptics might exploit to discredit the findings?  What might they be and how would they be answered? 

(RQs to pursue if time/data allows in order of importance)
Is there data to support continued polar ice cap retreat and how does this affect global temperature/climate change?
Assuming the data does support an anthropogenic model of climate change, what effects (past and present) that can be substantially linked to these changes? /
Assuming there is enough data to support the concept of climate change with patterns/trends, what effects (future) might be reasonably projected?

(Super Bonus RQs- only if time and energy allows)
What reasons might individuals/groups have for denying data that supports anthropogenic climate change and how might the data refute these claims?
What reasons might countries/state actors have for denying data that supports anthropogenic climate change and how might the data refute these claims?
