### Elizabeth: 
Sea Level Rise

### Alex: 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions/Concentration

### Danyelle: 
Extreme Weather Events

### Ryan: 
Temperature Differences/Patterns/Trends

### Research Questions:
Is there substantial and verfiable data that can be used as evidence to support the phenomenon of human induced climate change? /
How has this data been gathered/measured and can the data be trusted and verified? /
Are there trends/patterns in the data that are considerable enough to support a professional analysis with conclusions? What are limiatations in this data? /
If data exists to support climate change, what effects (past and present) that can be substantially linked to these changes? /
Assuming there is enough data to support the concept of climate change with patterns/trends, what projections can be reasonably drawn from the data for the future?

### Ryan's Research Questions for Temperature Variation /
#Has the earth undergone temperature changes since cerca the industrial revolution in the West?
#Is there a trend and/or pattern in those temperature changes?
#If patterns/trends are found, where are they most prominent?
#How can these temperature trends be measured?
#Where are temperature trends most salient?
#What are the data sources used to measure temperature over time?
#Why have these data sources been chosen?
#What makes these data sources reliable?
#What evidence might make these data sources questionable, if any?
  ##(Big Idea/Group Question) What are the effects and/or measureable physical changes that can be directly/causaly linked to the temperature trends if any?
How are different measurements/effects of climate change connected with the data from my group members and how can we use this data to measure these connections/networks of effects? Lastly, what conclusions and/or projections for the future can be drawn by combining our data and related findings?
